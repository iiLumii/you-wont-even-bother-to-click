As an Iraqi ex-muslim, im not gonna let you claim that islam is peaceful on the hands of european/american muslims, 
They do not represent islam one bit, and are not true muslims, they know nothing about islam and act as if islam is
peaceful based on their own actions instead of what islam orders and says even tho they have to follow proper law 
instead of shariaa law, They know nothing about sharaf, apostasy, clan wars, faction wars, blasphemy, kuffur, jihad etc.
If you came back to your home country you would be executed under an emir as a penalty of kuffur,

 *You do not deserve to be where you are in europe/america*

 you represent 2%!! 2% of the muslim community, YOU ARE NOT TRUE MUSLIMS, those killing in afghanistan are true muslims, 
 THATS ISLAMS TRUE FORM,
Take a look for yourself

*none of you are even gonna bother checking the sources because of how ignorant you are about islam being "perfect"*

Blasphemy execution of Farkhunda *RIP* watch at your own risk, but just feel the shame on your religion

Many believe that Jihadis are crazy and they kill inoccent people for no reason *cough cough, Team monke*
NO, they kill for religious reasons, the most popular is religious factions, a jihadis mind would think like:
I'm a sunni and you are a shiaa, therefore you must die because you are dishonouring my religious leaders, 
ALL MUSLIMS ARE TERRORISTS, They wouldnt kill you for no reason, therefore they wait for the time, Oh whats 
that? You left islam, time to go, but remember that islam is peaceful and we dont condone any killing :) ðŸ”«ðŸ”«ðŸ’£ðŸ’£ðŸ”ªðŸ”ª!
